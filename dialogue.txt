#Person1#: Ms. Dawson, I need you to take a dictation for me.
#Person2#: Yes, sir...
#Person1#: This should go out as an intra-office memorandum to all employees by this afternoon. Are you ready?
#Person2#: Yes, sir. Go ahead.
#Person1#: Attention all staff... Effective immediately, all office communications are restricted to email correspondence and official memos. The use of Instant Message programs by employees during working hours is strictly prohibited.
#Person2#: Sir, does this apply to intra-office communications only? Or will it also restrict external communications?
#Person1#: It should apply to all communications, not only in this office between employees, but also any outside communications.
#Person2#: But sir, many employees use Instant Messaging to communicate with their clients.
#Person1#: They will just have to change their communication methods. I don't want any - one using Instant Messaging in this office. It wastes too much time! Now, please continue with the memo. Where were we?
#Person2#: This applies to internal and external communications.
#Person1#: Yes. Any employee who persists in using Instant Messaging will first receive a warning and be placed on probation. At second offense, the employee will face termination. Any questions regarding this new policy may be directed to department heads.
#Person2#: Is that all?
#Person1#: Yes. Please get this memo typed up and distributed to all employees before 4 pm.
#Person1#: You're finally here! What took so long?
#Person2#: I got stuck in traffic again. There was a terrible traffic jam near the Carrefour intersection.
#Person1#: It's always rather congested down there during rush hour. Maybe you should try to find a different route to get home.
#Person2#: I don't think it can be avoided, to be honest.
#Person1#: perhaps it would be better if you started taking public transport system to work.
#Person2#: I think it's something that I'll have to consider. The public transport system is pretty good.
#Person1#: It would be better for the environment, too.
#Person2#: I know. I feel bad about how much my car is adding to the pollution problem in this city.
#Person1#: Taking the subway would be a lot less stressful than driving as well.
#Person2#: The only problem is that I'm going to really miss having the freedom that you have with a car.
#Person1#: Well, when it's nicer outside, you can start biking to work. That will give you just as much freedom as your car usually provides.
#Person2#: That's true. I could certainly use the exercise!
#Person1#: So, are you going to quit driving to work then?
#Person2#: Yes, it's not good for me or for the environment.
#Person1#: Kate, you never believe what's happened.
#Person2#: What do you mean?
#Person1#: Masha and Hero are getting divorced.
#Person2#: You are kidding. What happened?
#Person1#: Well, I don't really know, but I heard that they are having a separation for 2 months, and filed for divorce.
#Person2#: That's really surprising. I always thought they are well matched. What about the kids? Who get custody?
#Person1#: Masha, it seems quiet and makable, no quarrelling about who get the house and stock and then contesting the divorce with other details worked out.
#Person2#: That's the change from all the back stepping we usually hear about. Well, I still can't believe it, Masha and Hero, the perfect couple. When would they divorce be final?
#Person1#: Early in the New Year I guess.
#Person1#: Happy Birthday, this is for you, Brian.
#Person2#: I'm so happy you remember, please come in and enjoy the party. Everyone's here, I'm sure you have a good time.
#Person1#: Brian, may I have a pleasure to have a dance with you?
#Person2#: Ok.
#Person1#: This is really wonderful party.
#Person2#: Yes, you are always popular with everyone. and you look very pretty today.
#Person1#: Thanks, that's very kind of you to say. I hope my necklace goes with my dress, and they both make me look good I feel.
#Person2#: You look great, you are absolutely glowing.
#Person1#: Thanks, this is a fine party. We should have a drink together to celebrate your birthday
#Person1#: This Olympic park is so big!
#Person2#: Yes. Now we are in the Olympic stadium, the center of this park.
#Person1#: Splendid! When is it gonna be finished?
#Person2#: The whole stadium is to be finished this June.
#Person1#: How many seats are there in the stand?
#Person2#: Oh, there are 5000 seats in total.
#Person1#: I didn ' t know it would be so big!
#Person2#: It is! Look there, those are the tracks. And the jumping pit is over there.
#Person1#: Ah... I see. Hey, look the sign here, No climbing.
#Person2#: We put many signs with English translations for foreign visitors.
#Person1#: I've had it! I am done working for a company that is taking me nowhere!
#Person2#: So what are you gonna do? Just quit?
#Person1#: That's exactly what I am going to do! I have decided to create my own company! I am going to write up a business plan, get some investors and start working for myself!
#Person2#: Have you ever written up a business plan before?
#Person1#: Well, no, it can't be that hard! I mean, all you have to do is explain your business, how you are going to do things and that's it, right?
#Person2#: You couldn't be more wrong! A well written business plan will include an executive summary which highlights the idea of the business in two pages or less. Then you need to describe your company with information such as what type of legal structure it has, history, etc.
#Person1#: Well, that seems easy enough.
#Person2#: Wait, there is more! Then you need to introduce and describe your goods or services. What they are and how they are different from competitors? Then comes the hard part, a market analysis. You need to investigate and analyze hundreds of variables! You need to take into consideration socioeconomic factors from GDP per capita to how many children on average the population has! All this information is useful so that you can move on to your strategy and implementation stage, where you will describe in detail how you will actually execute your idea.
#Person1#: Geez. Is that all?
#Person2#: Almost, the most important piece of information for your investors will be the financial analysis. Here you will calculate and estimate sales, cash flow and profits. After all, people will want to know when they will begin to see a return on their investment!
#Person1#: Umm. I think I ' ll just stick to my old job and save myself all the hassle of trying to start up a business!
#Person1#: What's wrong with you? Why are you scratching so much?
#Person2#: I feel itchy! I can't stand it anymore! I think I may be coming down with something. I feel lightheaded and weak.
#Person1#: Let me have a look. Whoa! Get away from me!
#Person2#: What's wrong?
#Person1#: I think you have chicken pox! You are contagious! Get away! Don't breathe on me!
#Person2#: Maybe it's just a rash or an allergy! We can't be sure until I see a doctor.
#Person1#: Well in the meantime you are a biohazard! I didn't get it when I was a kid and I've heard that you can even die if you get it as an adult!
#Person2#: Are you serious? You always blow things out of proportion. In any case, I think I'll go take an oatmeal bath.
#Person1#: Good coming. What can I do for you?
#Person2#: I'm in Room 309. I'm checking out today. Can I have my bill now?
#Person1#: Certainly. Please wait a moment. Here you are.
#Person2#: Thanks. Wait... What's this? The 30 dollar for?
#Person1#: Excuse me... The charge for your laundry service on Nov. 20th.
#Person2#: But I did't take any laundry service during my stay here. I think you have added someone else's.
#Person1#: Ummmm...Sorry, would you mind waiting a moment? We check it with the department concerned.
#Person2#: No. As long as we get this straightened out.
#Person1#: I'm very sorry. There has been a mistake. We'll correct the bill. Please take a look.
#Person2#: Okay, here you are.
#Person1#: Goodbye.
#Person1#: Steven, I need badly your help.
#Person2#: What's the matter?
#Person1#: My wife has found that I have an affair with my secretary, and now she is going to divorce me.
#Person2#: How could you cheat on your wife? You have been married for ten years.
#Person1#: Yes, I know I'm wrong. But I swear that the affair lasts only for two months. And I still love my wife. I couldn't live without her.
#Person2#: I will try my best to persuade her to reconsider the divorce. But are you sure that from now on you will be faithful to her forever?
#Person1#: Yes, I swear.
#Person1#: Who stands out in your mind as a man or woman of sound character?
#Person2#: If I think of famous people, I think of Abraham Lincoln.
#Person1#: He's the US president, who walked five miles just to give a lady her change, isn't he?
#Person2#: That's the one. He also was famous for never giving up on his goals.
#Person1#: That's right. He ran for office quite a few times before he was finally elected.
#Person2#: And I also admire him for his courage in fighting for equal rights.
#Person1#: He had great vision, didn't he?
#Person2#: And humility. I would have liked to meet him personally.
#Person1#: Where are you going for your trip?
#Person2#: I think Hebei is a good place.
#Person1#: But I heard the north of China are experiencing severe sandstorms!
#Person2#: Really?
#Person1#: Yes, it's said that Hebes was experiencing six degree strong winds.
#Person2#: How do these storms affect the people who live in these areas?
#Person1#: The report said the number of people with respiratory tract infections tended to rise after sandstorms. The sand gets into people's noses and throats and creates irritation.
#Person2#: It sounds that sandstorms are trouble for everybody!
#Person1#: You are quite right.
#Person1#: Welcome to my birthday party, I am so happy you can come.
#Person2#: Thanks for inviting me. Here is the gift for you. Happy birthday, Francis! Many more happy and healthy years for you!
#Person1#: Thank you, shall I open it now?
#Person2#: Yes, please do.
#Person1#: Wow, a remote car model and my favorite brand. I really like it. That is so nice of you.
#Person2#: Yeah, I was really struggling whether I should give you this nice little car. It was the last one they had and I really like it so much myself.
#Person1#: Typical you, always wanting to keep the best things for yourself. The more I appreciate the gift now.
#Person1#: Hi, Tony. You look unhappy. What's wrong?
#Person2#: Oh, Steven, I made a big mistake.
#Person1#: What happened?
#Person2#: I really wish I hadn't done it.
#Person1#: What on earth are you talking about?
#Person2#: I got caught cheating. I feel so ashamed. The teacher saw me and told me I failed.
#Person1#: What were you thinking?
#Person2#: You know my father. If I fail, he'll kill me. I have to do well.
#Person1#: But what you should do is study hard.
#Person2#: I know. . . I know. . . it's all my fault. I feel awful that I didn't study, and I cheated, and I got caught.
#Person1#: So long as you learn from your mistakes.
#Person1#: What time is it, Tom?
#Person2#: Just a minute. It's ten to nine by my watch.
#Person1#: Is it? I had no idea it was so late. I must be off now.
#Person2#: What's the hurry?
#Person1#: I must catch the nine-thirty train.
#Person2#: You've plenty of time yet. The railway station is very close. It won't take more than twenty minutes to get there.
#Person1#: I don't know how to adjust my life. Would you give me a piece of advice?
#Person2#: You look a bit pale, don't you?
#Person1#: Yes, I can't sleep well every night.
#Person2#: You should get plenty of sleep.
#Person1#: I drink a lot of wine.
#Person2#: If I were you, I wouldn't drink too much.
#Person1#: I often feel so tired.
#Person2#: You better do some exercise every morning.
#Person1#: I sometimes find the shadow of death in front of me.
#Person2#: Why do you worry about your future? You're very young, and you'll make great contribution to the world. I hope you take my advice.
#Person1#: Would you like to go to the party tonight?
#Person2#: Whose party?
#Person1#: Ruojia's. Don't you know that? Ruojia has got married.
#Person2#: What! Is she really? I can't believe it!
#Person1#: Yes. Yesterday.
#Person2#: Good gracious. That's incredible! I feel so happy for her!
#Person1#: Yes, me too.
#Person2#: But how do you know that?
#Person1#: I saw the news from her twitter. And she sent an email about it.
#Person2#: What? I didn't receive it!
#Person1#: Maybe you should check your email.
#Person2#: Oh yes, I find it. Tonight at her home. Will you bring something?
#Person1#: Yes, a pair of wineglasses and a card to wish her happy marriage.
#Person2#: I will buy a tea set.
#Person1#: Yeah. Just pull on this strip. Then peel off the back.
#Person2#: You might make a few enemies this way.
#Person1#: If they don't think this is fun, they're not meant to be our friends.
#Person2#: You mean your friends. I think it's cruel.
#Person1#: Yeah. But it's fun. Look at those two ugly old ladies. . . or are they men?
#Person2#: Hurry! Get a shot!. . . Hand it over!
#Person1#: I knew you'd come around. . .
#Person1#: What does your sister look like, Mike?
#Person2#: Well, she's tall and pretty.
#Person1#: Is she like you?
#Person2#: I suppose so. We're both friendly and easy-going.
#Person1#: Is she as clever as you?
#Person2#: No, she's not as clever as me.
#Person1#: Big head!
#Person1#: Is anybody in?
#Person2#: How can I help you?
#Person1#: I have a headache.
#Person2#: Let me take your temperature with a thermometer.
#Person1#: OK.
#Person2#: I think you have a small fever.
#Person1#: I thought so. I felt dizzy this morning.
#Person2#: You should've called in sick! Next time, have either of your parents call the school office.
#Person1#: Can I help you?
#Person2#: I'd like to buy a new mobile phone please.
#Person1#: Ok, would you like a phone with camera and MP3 player?
#Person2#: Yes please. And I'd like to be able to make video calls too.
